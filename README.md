# avoidance-insprion Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my insprion running Void Linux. Very minimal; nothing fancy so far.

You can curl my neofetch! All you need to do is 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samueltwallace/avoidance-inspiron-dotfiles/master/neofetch
```
Note that my vimrc is not here; it is in another repo [here](https://github.com/samueltwallace/modvim)
